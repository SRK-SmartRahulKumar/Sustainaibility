      <h1>Carbon Cycle?</h1>
      <p class="text-xl">Carbon is the backbone of life on Earth. 
        We are made of carbon, we eat carbon, and our civilizations—our economies, our homes, 
        our means of transport—are built on carbon. We need carbon, but that need is also entwined with one of the most serious problems facing us today: 
        global climate change..
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl"> Forged in the heart of aging stars, carbon is the fourth most abundant element in the Universe. Most of Earth’s carbon—about 65,500 billion metric tons—is stored in rocks..</p>
      <p class="text-xl"> Carbon flows between each reservoir in an exchange called the carbon cycle, which has slow and fast components. Any change in the cycle that shifts carbon out of one reservoir puts more carbon in the other reservoirs. Changes that put carbon gases into the atmosphere result in warmer temperatures on Earth.</p>
      <strong class="text-xl text-blue-900"> The diagram on the left side is  of the fast carbon cycle shows the movement of carbon between land, atmosphere, and oceans.

      <h2>Why small increase in temperature a big deal?</h2>
      <p class="text-xl">The global average temperature combines the temperatures of all the hot places, all the cold places, and all the places in between. It is a very important measure of changes going on in Earth's machinery. A rise of just one degree Fahrenheit (°F) on a sunny day where you live has little effect. But over the whole Earth, a rise of 1°F makes a big difference. Just think, normally, water at 32°F is solid ice. But water at 33°F is liquid water.

Not only was 2016 the warmest year on record, but eight of the 12 months that make up the year — from January through September, with the exception of June — were the warmest on record for those respective months.

      <p class="text-xl">During the winter, the top layer of the ocean near the North Pole freezes solid. Every summer some of this ice melts. But not all of it melts. Some of the ice is so thick it stays frozen all the time, even throughout the summer. However, since 1979, when Earth-observing satellites began watching, the ice remaining at the end of summer has been getting smaller and smaller. At the end of summer 2009, the ice was only two-thirds as large as at the end of the summer of 1979. In August 2012, is was the smallest on record.

            <p>Research suggested that the southeast region of the United States has the most favorable conditions for afforestation due to its subtropical climate. 
              In addition, model results suggested that large areas of croplands in South Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin showed potential for carbon management and shouldn’t be underestimated.</p>
             <p>
              Using plants and soil to store atmospheric carbon dioxide could become part of our country’s enhanced land use management. 
              Generalized global estimates of stored carbon in afforested areas vary between temperate and tropical regions, but range as high as 4.5 billion tons of carbon per year, say scientists. 
              These estimates are from model results, not actual measurements, and many questions, scientific and economic, must be answered before such land use practices are adopted.

            <p>Scientists previously established that the world is greener than it was in the early 1980s. Updated maps show that the trend has continued, and researchers say reduced global warming is among the consequences.</p>
             <p>There is a clear greening trend in boreal and Arctic regions, a result of rising temperatures. For example, Svalbard in the high-Arctic has seen a 30 percent increase in greenness, according to Rama Nemani of NASA’s Ames Research Center, a co-author of the review paper in Nature Reviews Earth & Environment. The greening was concurrent with an increase in mean summer temperature from 2.9° to 4.7° Celsius (37.2° to 40.5° Fahrenheit) between 1986 and 2015.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is an interesting consequence of this global green up: as vegetation consumes some of the heat-trapping carbon dioxide it also performs evapotranspiration—a function similar to human sweating—which can have a cooling effect on the air. Scientists say that global greening since the early 1980s may have reduced global warming by as much as 0.2° to 0.25° Celsius (0.36° to 0.45° Fahrenheit). In othe
